# 404 City
The idea for **404 City: The Glitch Metropolis** was born from a simple question — *what if the internet’s broken code and 404 pages became alive?*   We imagined a city built entirely from digital decay: software bugs, abandoned memes, corrupted systems, and failed code updates. Inspired by cyberpunk worlds like *Blade Runner* and *Ghost in the Shell*, and nostalgic text adventures like *Zork* and *Fallen London*, we set out to fuse retro storytelling with cutting-edge AI.   Our goal: to create a space where chaos itself is playable — a sandbox of errors that somehow runs, powered by an intelligent game master.
